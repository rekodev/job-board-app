**Task: Building a Job Board Application**

**Description:**

Your task is to create a comprehensive web application for a job board. The application should allow users to browse and search for job listings. You'll be using React.js with Next.js for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend.

**Frontend Requirements:**

1. Create a new Next.js project to serve as the frontend of the application.
2. Implement a user interface that displays a list of job listings.
3. Provide search and filtering options to allow users to find jobs based on criteria like location, job type, or category.
4. Each job listing should display relevant information, such as job title, company, location, job type, and application deadline.
5. Users should be able to click on a job listing to view more details about the job.

**Backend Requirements:**

1. Create a Node.js project to serve as the backend of the application.
2. Set up an Express.js server to handle API requests from the frontend.
3. Create an API endpoint to fetch a list of sample job listings as JSON.
4. The backend should serve job listings with information such as title, company, location, type, and deadline.

**Integration:**

1. Connect the frontend and backend components. Use API calls to fetch job listings and populate the user interface.
2. Implement dynamic routing in Next.js to display detailed job information when a listing is clicked.

**Bonus (Optional, Choose One or More):**

1. Allow users to apply for jobs directly from the application by integrating a form or link to the company's application page.
2. Implement user authentication and profiles, allowing users to save favorite job listings.
3. Create a backend API for submitting new job listings to the application.
4. Use a database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store job listings, user information, and application data.
5. Enhance the user interface with responsive design and animations.
6. Deploy the application to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel for frontend, Heroku for backend).

**Submission:**

Share your completed project via a GitHub repository. Include instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
